# Taxi fare estimator
The <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction'>Kaggle competition</a> provides a dataset with about 55 million New York City taxi fares records. For this project, we use a randomly sorted subset of 120,000 records available in the "data" folder.

We run a neural to predict the fare of taxis.
